In a musical communication course, I designed an alert sound for a retail store. The challenge was to create a sound that blends seamlessly with the background music yet remains noticeable to staff. This alert could be used, for instance, when someone reaches for valuable items. I crafted the sounds by recording my guitar and applying audio effects to ensure they fit perfectly.

## Sound Samples

### "Slideoff"
{{< audio src="/audio/CS_sound1_slideoff.mp3" >}}

### "Slideoff" - in context
{{< audio src="/audio/CS_sound1_with_background.mp3" >}}

### "Fifth"
{{< audio src="/audio/CS_sound2_fifth.mp3" >}}

### "Fifth" - in context
{{< audio src="/audio/CS_sound2_with_background.mp3" >}}
