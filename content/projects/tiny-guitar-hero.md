For an embedded programming project, [@theoahfeldt](https://github.com/theoahfeldt) and I created a Guitar Hero replica. We developed the program for a PIC32 microcontroller using an IO shield and external buttons connected to the chip's hardware pins. Players must press the correct button combinations and strum at the right time as dots scroll down the tiny screen. The entire setup was housed in a striking red case and attracted a lot of attention at our project conference. The screen was embedded in the guitar neck, and a speaker played some wonderfully off-beat square waves. Naturally, no one could beat my high score.
