For our first "major" (3 weeks) project in school at the end of first year (back in 2018), we developed a chess game using GoLang and the Ebiten game library. The players take turns to move their pieces to any legal square, and the game ends with the capture of the opposing king. The rules for castling, en passant, and pawn promotion, as well as check and checkmate, were not implemented in the game, hence the "crappyness."
