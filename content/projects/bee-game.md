---

Inspired by a bee that visited our ice-cream during lunch, I created this game in one evening. The objective is to help the bee dodge falling stracciatella ice-cream. If hit, the bee gets covered in ice-cream, and the final score is displayed. I developed this game using Python and the Pygame library, and I also designed the artwork.
