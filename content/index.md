Welcome to my personal page. I'm Christian, a software engineer with a passion for
leadership, team dynamics, and culture. When I'm not working, you'll find me exploring
music, photography, and technology. I'm also involved in various non-profit
organizations, primarily working with youth development. This site showcases some of
my technical projects and my blog. Feel free to explore!
